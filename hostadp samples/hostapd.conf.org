# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
# Note that WPA3 is also configured with bit1 since it uses RSN just like WPA2.
# In other words, for WPA3, wpa=2 is used the configuration (and
# wpa_key_mgmt=SAE for WPA3-Personal instead of wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK).

#------WPA-Key Management Algoritms
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Set of accepted key management algorithms (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, or both). The
# entries are separated with a space. WPA-PSK-SHA256 and WPA-EAP-SHA256 can be
# added to enable SHA256-based stronger algorithms.
# WPA-PSK = WPA-Personal / WPA2-Personal
# WPA-PSK-SHA256 = WPA2-Personal using SHA256
# WPA-EAP = WPA-Enterprise / WPA2-Enterprise
# WPA-EAP-SHA256 = WPA2-Enterprise using SHA256
# SAE = SAE (WPA3-Personal)
# WPA-EAP-SUITE-B-192 = WPA3-Enterprise with 192-bit security/CNSA suite
# FT-PSK = FT with passphrase/PSK
# FT-EAP = FT with EAP
# FT-EAP-SHA384 = FT with EAP using SHA384
# FT-SAE = FT with SAE
# FILS-SHA256 = Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA256
# FILS-SHA384 = Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA384
# FT-FILS-SHA256 = FT and Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA256
# FT-FILS-SHA384 = FT and Fast Initial Link Setup with SHA384
# OWE = Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (a.k.a. Enhanced Open)
# DPP = Device Provisioning Protocol
# OSEN = Hotspot 2.0 online signup with encryption
# (dot11RSNAConfigAuthenticationSuitesTable)
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

#------CYPHER
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Set of accepted cipher suites (encryption algorithms) for pairwise keys
# (unicast packets). This is a space separated list of algorithms:
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCMP-128)
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
# CCMP-256 = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC with 256-bit key
# GCMP = Galois/counter mode protocol (GCMP-128)
# GCMP-256 = Galois/counter mode protocol with 256-bit key
# Group cipher suite (encryption algorithm for broadcast and multicast frames)
# is automatically selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher. The optional group_cipher parameter can
# be used to override this automatic selection.
#
# (dot11RSNAConfigPairwiseCiphersTable)
# Pairwise cipher for WPA (v1) (default: TKIP)
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

#------Authentication Algorithms 
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# IEEE 802.11 specifies two authentication algorithms. hostapd can be
# configured to allow both of these or only one. Open system authentication
# should be used with IEEE 802.1X.
# Bit fields of allowed authentication algorithms:
# bit 0 = Open System Authentication
# bit 1 = Shared Key Authentication (requires WEP)
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
auth_algs=1

#------MAC-Address Based Authentication
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Station MAC address -based authentication
# Please note that this kind of access control requires a driver that uses
# hostapd to take care of management frame processing and as such, this can be
# used with driver=hostap or driver=nl80211, but not with driver=atheros.
# 0 = accept unless in deny list
# 1 = deny unless in accept list
# 2 = use external RADIUS server (accept/deny lists are searched first)
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
macaddr_acl=0

#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# The own IP address of the access point (used as NAS-IP-Address)
